[The auto-generated docs](https://gsburmaster.github.io/448-Project1/docs/autodocs/index.html) were made with [documentation.js](https://documentation.js.org).<br/>
We estimated 50 total hours (~10 hours per person) to complete the project. We agreed this seemed reasonable based on the scope of the project and the amount of time we had to complete the project. The [final work log](https://gsburmaster.github.io/448-Project1/docs/EECS%20448%20Project%201%20Worklog.pdf) can be found in the docs.
